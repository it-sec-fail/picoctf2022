## Description
Here's a program that plays rock, paper, scissors against you. I hear something good happens if you win 5 times in a row.
Connect to the program with netcat:
`nc saturn.picoctf.net 53296`
The program's source code with the flag redacted can be downloaded [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/447/game-redacted.c).
