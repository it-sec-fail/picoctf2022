## Description
There's something fishy about this PIN-code checker, can you figure out the PIN and get the flag?
Download the PIN checker program here [pin_checker](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/148/pin_checker)
Once you've figured out the PIN (and gotten the checker program to accept it), connect to the master server using `nc saturn.picoctf.net 52026` and provide it the PIN to get your flag.
