 1. Lets have a look into the svg file
 1. It looks like a normal file
 1. In the last lines of the file, in the `tspan` tag, we can see some interessting characters... looks like the end of the flag.

```svg
         id="tspan3764">F { 3 n h 4 n </tspan><tspan
         sodipodi:role="line"
         x="107.43014"
         y="132.11588"
         style="font-size:0.00352781px;line-height:1.25;fill:#ffffff;stroke-width:0.26458332;"
         id="tspan3752">c 3 d _ 5 6 e 8 7 c 9 6 }</tspan>
```

 1. We could extract this characters, which leads us to the flag with spaces... just remove it and you'll get the flag.
