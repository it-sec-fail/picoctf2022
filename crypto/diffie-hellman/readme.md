## Description
Alice and Bob wanted to exchange information secretly. The two of them agreed to use the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm, using p = 13 and g = 5. They both chose numbers secretly where Alice chose 7 and Bob chose 3. Then, Alice sent Bob some encoded text (with both letters and digits) using the generated key as the shift amount for a Caesar cipher over the alphabet and the decimal digits. Can you figure out the contents of the message?
